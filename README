The signle running logbook for Logging my runs

The most successful athletes log their workouts, 
which holds them accountable to themselves for their performance 
and helps them watch for patterns and track different training strategies used 
and mileage.

Instructions

1 Begin each entry with a goal. 
This can be any kind of goal relating to your running, 
but gives you something to push for. 
Your goal may be to complete a specific distance or maintain a specific pace 
or even to run through discomfort that you have been experiencing.

2 Include the duration, distance and pace of your run. 
You can make notes on the route taken and difficulty of the terrain. 
You can also note a weekly mileage total here.

3 Record your resting heart rate daily and your post-exercise heart rate.
        
4 Record the time of day and weather conditions during your run. 
Remember to include the temperature.

5 Note any walk breaks taken, duration of these and the reason for the breaks.
        
6 Record any splits taken during speed training.
        
7 Rate how you felt before, during and after your run. 
Add any reasons for giving the rating you did, 
which may have affected this rating. 
Be sure to include reasons the rating may have been raised or lowered, 
such as getting a promotion or not feeling well.

8 Record your thoughts on the run. Note any reflections you had, 
who you ran with and their effect on your motivation, 
if you had to force yourself out the door, any new routes you noted 
that you may want to try someday and anything else you feel applies to your run.
        
9 Record the shoes you wore in order to track the mileage on them.
        
10 Keep track of race information in your running log for easy access.    

Record all of the above information when recording 
a race as well as the contact information of the race organizer 
and any websites related to the race. 
This will allow you to easily remember this information for future use.
